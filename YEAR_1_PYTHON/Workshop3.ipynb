    "A common use of ```for``` loops is the calculation of running totals. For instance, suppose you would like to calculate the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). If you were to do this by hand you would start by adding the first two odd numbers together:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",

To keep track of the running sum we use a variable known as an *accumulator* (for the purposes of this example we shall call this variable ```s```). Initially we set the value ```s = 0``` because no numbers have been added to it yet. Next we update the value of the accumulator by adding the first number, ```s + 1 = 1```. Then we add the next number, 3, and update the accumulator accordingly - ```s + 3 = 4```. We repeat this process until we have added the final number to the accumulator. \n",
