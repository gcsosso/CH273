    "In workshop 1 we discussed two important *classes* of data, numbers and strings. We also saw how we could attach names to numbers and strings through the use of variables - allowing them to be stored and used repeatedly in code without having to type them out in full each time. Suppose we had a collection of numbers or strings that we wanted to use in our code (for instance, it could be a series of temperature measurements). One option open to us is to give each of these objects its own variable name - for example ```temperature_1```, ```temperature_2```, *etc*. Obviously this becomes extremely tedious as the number of objects increases. Instead, we can store collections of data directly using *lists* and *arrays*. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, lists and arrays seem to do exactly the same thing (and indeed, can often be used interchangably). However, they have many important differences, and as such we will be treating them seperately in this workshop. "
